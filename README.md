Sprint 1:
In sprint 1 our goal was to test and execute data preprocessing functions. 
To do this we installed the preprocessing code and ran python unit tests on different functions.
We ran most of our tests on the normalization and import functions.
These tests can be found in the main directory, with the preprocessing code found in the "data_preprocessing.ipynb
