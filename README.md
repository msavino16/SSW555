This is the readme file for our SSW555 Project. In this project we take brain scan data and develop software to display the brain information.

This is first achieved by takign the information gathered from brain scans to the cloud.
Next we take that data and process it with developed algorithims for visualization.
We then use this processed data to display the active brain areas using our developed UI.
We believe that this tool can be used to help understand the human brain and how it works.
You can look into the repo and find our work there.

Sprint 1:
In sprint 1 our goal was to test and execute data preprocessing functions. 
To do this we installed the preprocessing code and ran python unit tests on different functions.
We ran most of our tests on the normalization and import functions.
These tests can be found in the main directory, with the preprocessing code found in the "data_preprocessing.ipynb

Sprint 2:
In sprint 2 we now want to apply our algorithims for data processing and visualization.
To do this we take the data and process it through the normalization and reshaping functions.
We then use this data to being visualization in the next sprint.
These files can be found in the main repo.
